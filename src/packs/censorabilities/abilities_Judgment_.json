If another censor judges the target, then your judgment on the target ends.\n\nIf a judged creature uses an action and you have line of effect to them, you can use a free triggered action to deal holy damage equal to twice your Presence score to them.\n\nWhen the judged creature is reduced to 0 Stamina, you can use a free triggered action to use this ability against a new target within distance.\n\nIn addition, you can spend 1 wrath to take one of the following free triggered actions. You canâ€™t use more than one instance of a benefit per trigger:\n\n* When an adjacent judged target shifts, you can make a melee free strike against them. The target doesn't shift and their speed becomes 0 until the end of this turn.\n* When a judged target makes a power roll, you can add a bane to the roll.\n* When a judged target within distance uses an ability with a potency against another creature, you reduce the potency of the ability by 1 for that creature (to a minimum of 0).",
