You might take on the appearance of a harmless animal of your size, such as a sheep or capybara, or you might appear as a less heroic, unarmed, and capable version of yourself. While this illusion lasts, your strikes made against other creatures gain an edge. If you use this ability in combat, you gain a surge when you use it.\n\nThe illusion ends when you harm another creature, when you and any creature physically interact, when you use this ability again, or when you end the illusion (no action required)."
