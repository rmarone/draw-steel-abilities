Rather than defending their settlements and breeding grounds against hostile creatures, these poisonous frog folk prefer to establish their homes in places that are nigh-impossible for other humanoids to find, such as underwater caves and other enclosed spaces only accessible by water.

					"description": "\nMortal scholars have classified demons into ten categories, and the higher a demon’s category, the more powerful the fiend. Though demons don’t use these classifications themselves, this system reflects their hierarchy, as stronger demons bully the weak into service. \n\nEach time a demon consumes a soul, there’s a chance they might evolve into a more powerful demon. The evolution from one category to the next can be instant, or it can take years. This inconsistency has led to much scholarly debate on whether all souls are equal, or whether demonic evolution is aided by the consumption of souls that are especially corrupt—or heroic.\n\nThe following demons have been identified across categories 1-3:\n• **Pitlings** resemble rodents or insects, but possess gleaming green eyes and terrible body odor, and disgorge a viscous, toxic phlegm.\n\n• **Ensnarers** are the result of pitlings getting ahold of an unfortunate soul. The pitling is in the process of digesting the soul of a creature, physically boring through its head, and flopping around like an appendage. The body is puppeteered and mid transformation into a demon, with mouths forming on the creature’s hands and arms that shoot out long, barbed tongues as attacks. \n\n• **Frenzied** are similar to ensnarers, but their transformation into a true demon is more advanced, resulting in a fast and viscous creature full of energy and hunger for more souls. \n\n• Rumored to be the initial source of the teachings of all shadows through the College of Black Ash, **remasches** are demons whose physical form is blended with the nature of the wastes where they dwell. A remasch teleports around the battlefield, inflicting chaos on their enemies directly or through the minions they control.  \n\n• Possessed of glowing eyes and tendril-ringed maws, **ruinants** breathe with a sickening wheeze and have bodies covered in inflamed scars. A ruinant can inflict fresh wounds and burns on their victims in a pattern mirroring those on the demon’s own body. \n\n• **Torlases** are piecemeal abominations whose physical forms don’t obey the normal laws of geometry. They control the battlefield by using living flesh and whipping allies and enemies alike into advantageous position. \n\n• **Bendraks** appear as an amalgamation of flesh and shards of a broken mirror, able to shape their bodies to distract and confuse their foes. A bendrak can divert an enemy’s attack to another enemy or hide themselves or allies behind dazzling reflections. \n\n• **Mucerons** are the result of an ensnarer going through repeated demon evolutions to become a brutish creature, covered in several mouths that shoot out barbed tongues, pulling an enemy’s attention along with pulling them physically.  \n\n• **Chorogaunts** are terrifying demon leaders. Each is an amalgamation of several demon bodies formed into a mobile, living musical instrument. Several heads are arranged into a chorus embedded in the demon’s chest and its ribs are upturned into a fleshy pipe organ. Their attacks entrance and confuse enemies, making them more vulnerable to other demons."

A weeping seam opens to reveal a demonic eye whose gaze melts flesh from bone.\n\n• **Fangling** bodies are overgrown with teeth, fangs, and tusks from a thousand different creatures. Deadly to take on in close quarters, they’ve been known to get caught on one another.\n\n• **Gunge** demons are horrifically distended with maws that could swallow a horse whole. It vomits up bilious slime that traps and dissolves any unlucky enough to get caught in it.\n\n• **Niktin** are cunning hunters that disguise themselves as mundane objects that leave an oily foul smelling red residue wherever they are left. Their natural form is a humanoid made of red oil.\n\n• **Tourmenauk’s** resemble a hulking ape with a dozen or more extra mouths distributed around their body. Though their brute force is formidable enough, this demon also inflicts raw psychic pain by screaming from their mouths in different voices—often using the agonized voices of souls the tormenauk has devoured.\n\n• The **Lumbering Egress** is a walking mass of warped flesh around a giant whirling portal to the demonic realms. Lesser demons pour out at alarming rates making these creatures devastating siege engines."

A dark forge of abandoned creativity melted down in fires of spite, jealousy, and hate.\n\nThese metallic dragons are massive, heavy creatures requiring an immense release of heat to engage in flight. Their scales range from gleaming silver to blackened iron, depending on fastidiously they are about cleaning, and occasionally gilded with more precious metals. When threatened, they can encase themselves in shields they have embedded subcutaneously beneath their scales. Their long tails terminate with a massive, hammer-like tip that can freeze over and instantly cool hot metal.",

Occasionally they will take over a fortress or outpost, but wherever they settle the first thing in place is their colossal anvil. From there, the dragon consumes vast amounts of iron, expressing their dragonseal by slagging it in their belly to create a fortress of steel around them. Much of the slag is expelled into heated vats for forging, but they keep a small reserve inside their gut in case they need to melt any intrusive adventurers. \n\nEventually their entire lair is coated with hardened metal and discarded weapons, armor, and shields. This makes the lair of any crucible dragon hazardous to navigate, and extremely conductive of electricity."

Joris’nyrathi, The Scorching Aegis, is said to have a collection of shields that would rival any god of the forge.\n\nObsession aside, crucible dragons do manage to accrue large amounts of armaments and armor in their hoards. They care little for gems and gold, other than melting them down for filigree and embossment on the weapons and armor they forge. Adventurers plundering a crucible dragon’s hoard may not find much wealth but will usually find enough materials and armaments to supply several wars simultaneously."

These suits were initially used for utility and construction purposes but can be repurposed and refitted for warfare when the need arises.\n\nWord of these wonderous dwarven creations quickly spread among the tunnels of the underground, and up into the overworld.

These territorial elementals usually question interlopers from afar—and if they don’t like the answers, they rain down fire before their foes can draw near. \n\nWhile many elementals weave their innate gifts into oral storytelling, cruxes of fire are particularly adroit at animating their stories in silhouettes of flame."

Also insatiably curious, the essences often swoop down to talk when they see travelers."

Those who excel move on to become duskcallers, mournblades, and eclipses: paragons of strength who are venerated by the people. Research and discovery are employed for the primary purpose of furthering military goals. Even the popular children’s game hide and seek is a military device created to prepare a people for constant, imminent conflict."

They know and enjoy their reputation among humans as snatching children who wander too far into the woods. Humans should fear the trees.\n\nTheir natural ability to mask their presence, called glamor, compliments their guerilla style of fighting, striking quickly from cover and then melding back into the underbrush. These traits also make those few who dwell in human cities naturally adept at urban warfare.",

To breathe life into these creations, the wode elves lift their voices in song. The more intricate the song, the more durable and autonomous the creation becomes. A wodenelg’s rider is typically also their singer, creating a connection between the two that can last a lifetime.\n\nLegends tell of ancient beings, older than the forests themselves, that were sung to life by an entire wode elf civilization joined in sixteen-part harmony. They outlived their creators and roam the world as unknowable guardians who answer to nothing but their final set of instructions."

This isn’t some telepathic connection, but rather a great understanding of every corner of the wode and a hypersensitivity to changes within it. The stench of an amateur campfire, the sudden squawk of a raven, the forced march of a hungry ant colony: all of this information comes together to form a wode elf’s understanding of their surroundings.\n\nA wode elf develops this sense for their home over time, meaning that a wode elf who lives in an urban environment has just as much understanding of their neighborhood as their cousin in the forest does the trees."

One group of scavenging parties, known as the Blightless, searches the forest for lost mortals. They seek to eliminate these threats by any means possible. Overzealous and aggressive, the Blightless seek to expand the boundaries of their home, attacking civilizations that exist close to the forest’s edge. Because Blightless attacks constitute the majority of mortal interaction with the wode elves, they set the tone for mortal perception of a mostly peaceful people."

Known among themselves as rogabrin, meaning “more of us” in their language, goblins are one of the most numerous humanoids in the world. They can be found in every environment humans occupy and in places many other humanoids avoid, including deep cave systems.\n\nTheir long arms and prehensile toes make goblins particularly well adapted to environments requiring climbing, and they live equally comfortably in treetop cities as in subterranean realms filled with stalactites, ledges, and chasms. However, just as many prefer to dwell in tight-knit neighborhoods within diverse cities. Many of those goblins who cross swords with adventuring heroes are the worst of their society - thieves and murderers shunned by their own people.",

A dozen outlaw goblins are supremely confident - perhaps overly so. Such groups often become bandits who ambush travelers crossing through their territory, be it desert, forest, or underground. Larger bands might become unscrupulous mercenaries serving powerful villains. No matter how they’re encountered, goblins prefer to fight as an overwhelming force and to flee when foes outnumber friends."

They also fiercely defend themselves against anyone who threatens or gets too close to their nests.",

Some humanoid cultures raise griffons as mounts for the military or city guard, and griffon eggs can fetch a fine price.\n\nDaring poachers sometimes attempt to steal griffon eggs from wild aeries, but such thieves typically meet their end by griffon beak or talon. So great is the death toll that many localities have outlawed the poaching of griffon eggs."

They hide their nests in enormous treetops, scrubby thickets clinging to a cliff, or similarly sheltered nooks that are nearly unreachable for creatures who can’t fly. Each aerie holds up to three eggs during brooding season, which lasts for several months in the early spring. Chicks hatch after forty days of incubation, then they remain in or near the nest as their parents feed the rapidly growing flightless chick. About forty days after hatching, a griffon chick learns to fly—and after that, it’s only a matter of days before they set out from their nest into the wider world, generally making their own nest somewhere nearby."

The latter only feeds on carrion, and experts continue to debate whether they should be considered a true griffon or if they deserve their own categorization. Rumors of a massive condor-tiger griffon have recently sprung up, and whether or not their existence is true, it has opened questions of whether these creatures came about naturally or were fashioned by magic hands. Still, many scholars offer abundant rewards to adventurers who can return with evidence of rare or undiscovered griffon types."

			"description": "Kobold communities, called legions, are found in every biome and across the timescape. Gravitating toward powerful allies and defensible locations, kobolds are equally common in walled cities, secluded temples, subterranean tunnel-mazes, and dragon lairs. Most legions strive to be good neighbors or to go entirely unnoticed, but when a community falls under the sway of a malevolent wyrm or power-hungry centurion, they pose a significant threat.",

					"description": "\nIn a world filled with bigger, hungrier creatures, kobolds survived by becoming experts in collective defense. Kobold shield tactics are legendary; every warrior carries a shield into battle, and soldiers defend each other in tightly choreographed formations. More than a tool, a kobold’s shield is a symbol of their commitment to defending their legion, and they decorate these treasured possessions with battle trophies and illustrations of great deeds.\n\nKobold legionaries may join worthy adventurers as retainers, lending their defensive prowess to their new allies as they ko-boldly go where no kobold has gone before."

					"id": "kobold-info-2",

					"description": "Relentless innovators, kobolds can easily outsmart anyone who doesn’t take them seriously. Their foes haven’t experienced a true kobold battle until they survive exploding javelins or flaming nets. Kobold homes are protected with deadly hazards and ambush points. In open warfare, legions deploy mechanical dragons and flaming spike pit traps."
				},
				{
					"id": "kobold-info-3",
					"name": "Tiny Dragons",
					"description": "Most kobolds believe their ancestors were created by powerful dragons - and with sharp, angular features and prominent dorsal crests, they certainly look the part! Newborn kobolds have brilliant, pearlescent scales; as kobolds age, their scales dim and mottle. Owing to a deep magical connection, a legion that lives in the domain of a dragon adopts the color of that dragon’s scales over several generations."
				},
				{
					"id": "kobold-info-4",
					"name": "Domain Expansion",
					"description": "When kobolds settle into the domain of a dragon, they become more like that dragon in more than just color. Some groups worship the dragon like a god. Others revere them as a leader or ancestor, or admire them like a really (REALLY) big brother. This manifests as a desire to understand the dragon’s affinity so as to embody it. Kobolds see themselves as an extension of that domain, working with and for it. Meteor kobolds, for example, may rely more on hanging traps. Bloodthirsty omen kobolds deny themselves material pleasures and may end up wasting away into little more than skeletons. It has been speculated that kobolds living inside a domain do influence the size and strength of the dragon’s hold on the territory."

					"name": "Kobold and Dragon Symbiosis",
					"description": "Most dragons are solitary creatures, but kobolds living in their domain provide both parties with clear benefits. A dragon can establish their domain over an area in half the time if they allow kobolds to settle in the area as well. Meanwhile, a kobold that spends 1 week or more living within the domain of a dragon becomes immune to the hazardous and negative effects of that domain. The kobold’s physical appearance may also change the longer they stay in the area."

					"description": "All of this – the kobolds’ innovative spirit, affinity for their terrain, group defenses, and creative tactics – makes a kobold legion the master of the area in which they live. While they employ traps and tricks of their own creations, they also know the ins and outs of nature’s traps. For example, a sagittarius might shoot at a nearby hive of angry bees instead of their opponent. If your kobold opponents retreat over a frozen lake or desert sands, don’t give chase; they likely know something about these terrain hazards that you do not."

When the medusa wishes, beams from their eyes can slowly petrify others to stone.\n\nThe gods who use this punishment spread terrifying myths about medusas, causing mortals to attack and shun them. This often drives medusas into solitude—or to places haunted by creatures who don’t judge them based on mere appearance and horror stories. Many plot ways to break their curse, searching for lost healing rituals or secrets to use against the gods who cursed them.

When her revolution was crushed, the Lords of Kham used their beastmagics to twist Thesia’s mortal body into a human-bull hybrid prone to fits of violent rage. The Beast Lords placed this minotaur at the center of a vast labyrinth and sent captured rebels to attack the monster. Many fell to Thesia’s anger—until a prisoner named Velathri took a chance, speaking to the minotaur instead of brandishing steel. He befriended Thesia, and in retribution, the Beast Lords made him a minotaur as well. This act was their undoing, for Thesia and Velathri fell in love. New minotaurs were born, and decades later, hundreds charged out of the maze together. These minotaurs reduced Kham to ruins, then they spread far and wide, fearing reprisal from neighboring lands. Even today, many minotaurs shun civilization, preferring to live in winding canyons, twisting ruins, bewildering dungeons, or other maze-like terrain where they can continue to hunt. However, a few can be found in nearly any terrain or settlement."

They’ve settled into villages and cities, hot and cold climates, high in the mountains and deep underground. Most orcs live in diverse humanoid societies, though a few live secluded in the tropics.\n\nThough orcs are no more likely to stand in the adventurers’ way than any other folk, those who do fill the same roles as other humanoids: mercenaries, bounty hunters, garroters, guards, cultists, and corrupt kings.",

Their hair, which can range from coarse to fine, extends from their heads and drapes across their shoulders like royal mantles. Strong tusks extend past their lips and guard the rest of their teeth.\n\nFew other humanoids can match the endurance of an orc, and orcs who train for hunting and combat can rally themselves to move faster and prevail longer. Should an orc find themself on the brink of death, their veins instinctively surge with “blood fire,” glowing brightly and invigorating them to perform one last attack. Blood fire often appears red, though orcs from the mountains and underground glow blue and white respectively."

In times of peace, orcs domesticate them to plow the earth and eat pests—and in times of war, mohlers reshape the battlefield and knock the orcs’ enemies off their feet. \n\nWhen an orc community has exceptional gratitude for the deeds of one of their own or an outsider, they bestow the companionship of a mohler upon the individual. Treated kindly, mohlers make steadfast companions, protecting their caregivers with their lives. If mistreated, a mohler returns to their original den, and the orcs hunt the responsible party."

Should anyone ask, many radenwights speak of being a ratfolk when they’re alone, but always a radenwight when part of a group. Radenwight groups proudly call themselves a “meddle,” and have a knack for appearing where others hoped they wouldn’t or whenever they are least expected. Radenwight meddles can be found in the wilderness as easily as in any city, so long as there’s suitable work and excitement to keep the members of the meddle occupied.\n\nIf radenwights’ enemies expect them to scurry away like rats, they will be painfully surprised to see the combined arrows, bodies, and blades of a meddle thrown against them all at once. Whatever radenwights do, they do it fearlessly, with deeply cherished values of bravery and fair play shining through even the most rakish and roguish of them. Radenwights aren’t above banditry if it would support the meddle, but they greatly prefer to overwhelm, knock down, and knock out their targets rather than engage in deadly violence. They prefer weapons of precision and look for opportunities to strike as they and their comrades create openings for one another.",

Radenwights learn boldness from birth and are taught to hurl themselves fearlessly against any challenge that stands in their way. The key to this bravery is the intense bond of trust that exists between every radenwight, their comrades, and their community, and the knowledge that every other radenwight will act just as decisively as they do. In a scrap, it’s not one radenwight’s blade or arrow that brings down the foe, but the instant and instinctual follow-up from their fellows."

Somewhat more common is the spontaneous discovery of magical aptitude through music, as the culture of radenwight meddles strongly emphasizes both music and dance. Radenwights are particularly drawn to flutes and panpipes, inspired by the legend of a flutist who enraptured an evil dragon while her meddle lined up a suitably sized boulder to be dropped from the cliff above."

The radenwight maestro leads his band in complex city-wide robberies that always seem to be one step ahead of any would-be ratcatchers. Some say Maclette leads his life of crime to provide for his meddle, while others claim he strives to be king of the criminal world.\n\nIn truth, The Great Maclette finds beauty in the thrill of the heist. Robbery is as euphonious as music to his ears, and the maestro treats every operation like a new composition. As long as his band remains at large, he’ll always be looking to outdo himself with his next great masterpiece."

The shambling mound knows only that they must grow, and to grow they must feed—and thus they drag themself in search of a hunting ground.\n\nIt is believed these magical origins are what give shambling mounds their ability to produce poisons. These poisons range from region to region—for example, the toxins from a shambling mound along coastal beaches or swamps might appear milky white and smell sweet like manchineel trees, while shambling mounds found in rainforests might give off a heady, intoxicating sweet scent at night, luring victims in with beautiful pale blooms like angel’s trumpets and producing intense hallucinations for those unfortunate enough to become poisoned.\n\nWhile more specific effects may vary, each shambling mound’s toxins typically have the same aim: enervate their foes, so that they might magically absorb that strength and vitality."

For a few, it was a choice to become something other than a mortal. No matter the reason for their creation, all undead were once living creatures who walk the land after death in defiance of the natural order. \n\nRotting zombies, seductive vampires, wailing wraiths, and more undead stalk the widespread horror stories nobles and commoners alike tell each another around low-burning hearths. Even the most isolated hermits know that the dead can rise, eager to kill. These popular tales fuel many people’s fears of the undead. Mere rumors of a nearby ghoul pack can send an entire community into a panic.

Ghouls, skeletons, wights, and zombies number among the lesser corporeal undead. Most lack a soul, and many can’t think beyond the orders of their creators (unlike more powerful corporeal undead, such as liches and vampires). Those who aren’t controlled by others typically have a singular focus: the destruction of all living things. \n\nThe magic that animates a corpse removes the need for air, sleep, and sustenance. These spells also halt decay, preserving the undead at the stage of deterioration when magic touched them. While most corporeal undead are brought to unlife by a creator, there are tales of zombies suddenly rising from graveyards during rare astrological occurrences, skeletal soldiers emerging from mass graves on the anniversary of their death, and other seemingly spontaneous acts of necromancy."

When the process is complete, the mindkiller gains all the victim’s knowledge and memories and can puppet the body, becoming the perfect spy for the mindkiller’s synlirii overlords.\n\nMindkiller whelps are a lesser form of mindkiller that can be created in a fraction of the time. While they can’t inhabit bodies, their mere presence weakens their foes’ mental defenses against psionics"

War dogs are thus metaphysically unstable, incapable of higher spiritual functions like empathy or love, and their personalities and beliefs are highly malleable.

A single deviation from an order, no matter how rational or well-considered, can get a lowly soldier sent back to the Body Banks. Therefore, lower-ranking war dogs rarely alter tactics or show initiative.

Heroes may be surprised to discover their allies are members of the Grasp. When they meet Xorannox, he’s delighted! He loves treating with humanoids! They have the same enemies, after all.\n\nUnfortunately, no matter how useful or dependable a party of heroes might be, Xorannox is nearly incapable of resisting the urge to betray his allies. He assumes, as do most vaurathi, that the natural end of all alliances is betrayal. Thus when the gauntlet is thrown, and his life is in danger, the only minions he can truly trust are his own six eyes."

You might start a project to discover lore because the information can’t be discovered through a regular test, or you could do so because you failed a test to recall information and now want to learn it through research.\n\nWhen you start a project to discover lore, you choose the lore you want investigated and the questions you want answered. The Director tells you if the lore you seek amounts to common, obscure, lost, or forbidden knowledge. The more esoteric the knowledge, the more project points are required to find the answers you seek.\n\nWhen you begin a Discover Lore project, other creatures can also work on the project, using their respite activity to contribute a project roll to it in order to get the work done faster.\n\n| Project             | Goal |\n|:--------------------|:-----|\n| Common knowledge    | 15   |\n| Obscure knowledge   | 45   |\n| Lost knowledge      | 120  |\n| Forbidden knowledge | 240  |\n\n**Common Knowledge**: Common knowledge is generally easy to discover with a day or so of research. It’s not known by every passerby and takes time to uncover, but with plentiful local sources for the information, you don’t need to spend a lot of time searching. It could be that you need to question several members of a rumor mill to figure out who a noble is not-so-secretly courting, or you might need to spend a few hours in a temple to find the particular religious text that carries a seldom-used alternative name for a deity.\n\n**Obscure Knowledge**: Obscure knowledge is known only to specialized sages and is typically of interest only to those scholars. As such, precious few tomes are written on obscure subjects. Finding the right expert to interview or the best book to read typically requires several days of research. Uncovering the details of a ritual used to open and close a portal to the Sea of Stars isn’t easy information to come by, but there are people out there who know how to do it  -  and who wrote the instructions down.\n\n**Lost Knowledge**: Lost knowledge is so esoteric that even among a field’s most dedicated scholars, there might be only one or two individuals who have dug deep enough to know that lore. Lost knowledge could come from a time so long ago that only a single text in a dead language now holds the lore you seek. Such lore often takes more than a week to hunt down. The location of a legendary steel dwarf’s workshop is most likely lore that is lost - except for one map hidden in a private collection.\n\n**Forbidden Knowledge**: Forbidden knowledge is lore that a powerful individual or organization is attempting to keep secret. Those who know the secrets speak of them in whispered codes after passwords are exchanged, and write texts using ciphers. Hunting down leads and making sense of them typically takes weeks. The location of the dagger that slit the throat of the god of death is hidden behind layers of encoded text, and written in a dead language known only to that god’s most devout followers.",
